# Workhealth
The Workhealth app was designed to help medical specialists timely identify any warning health-related symptoms and notify the manager before starting a work shift. In this way, the application contributes to the mitigation and prevention of the disease spread and helps medical facilities keep their employees and patients healthy. When a user opens the app, they will see a survey with health-related questions. Based on the userâ€™s answers, the application will determine whether the user can attend work or whether they should seek medical help. If the user is allowed for work, they will receive a unique one-day code that they should present to the security guard or administrator upon arriving at work. The codes are generated on a daily basis and thus cannot be used repeatedly. This prevents employees from skipping the survey and encourages them to closely monitor their health state.
